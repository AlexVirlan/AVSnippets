If you want to use some public APIs from Solscan.io such as https://api.solscan.io/v2/account/v2/tokens you will need the AuBe header in your request. Without it, the request will not work - and yes, you can use the one generated by their FE app, but it will work just for a short period. The best solution is to generate a new one for every request. 
This script will do just that. It's kind of "reverse-engineered" (I like this word) from their obfuscated FE code.
